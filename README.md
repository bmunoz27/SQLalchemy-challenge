I have decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with my trip planning, I need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what I have done:

Climate Analysis and Exploration

1.Precipitation Analysis- Retrieved data from the past 12 months on precipation in the area and plot it in a graph.
2.Station analysis- Calculate the number of stations, identify the most active stations, and retrieved temperature data from those stations.
